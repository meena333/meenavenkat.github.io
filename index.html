        <h2>Introducing myself</h2>

   
<p>Hi There! Thanks for visiting my page. I'm an Indian born Canadian, living in the Netherlands for almost 7 years now. I'm not new to the field of IT, I'm currently working as a Software Tester and I've worked in various related positions for about a decade now. However, I'm looking to make a slight career change and focus on web development. I'm excited to go back to school and to join Codaisseur's class of 28!</p>
